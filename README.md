Customer Churn Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a dataset with customer service usage and demographic information. Various machine learning models were applied, including RandomForest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. The data was preprocessed using tools like StandardScaler and LabelEncoder, and the models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and develop insights to enhance customer retention strategies.
